# Jason Kundi Portfolio

Here is a portfolio website I have created to showcase all of my favourite projects.

I wanted to learn something new whilst making this site. As well as building in my favourite framework React, I wanted to try out the Gastby framework and graphQL. Gatsby for example takes care of some really arbitrary actions such as page routing which I was eager to see in action. GraphQL is also meant to be pretty straighforward and saves time in building your APIs.
